                Hello! If you found this website, then it seems that you're friends with Bob, or are friends of friends of Bob :D
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope you are managing to hold it together during the Dark Ages part 2.
            </p>
            <h5><b>Wait, what the heck is Bob doing?</b></h5>
            <p>
                As a quick rundown of what this is, my blockmates and I will be sharing a storage garage off-campus (<a href="https://www.extraspace.com/storage/facilities/us/massachusetts/" target="_blank">ExtraSpace Storage</a> + <a href="https://www.uhaul.com/Truck-Rentals/" target="_blank">U-Haul</a>) and splitting the costs. Note that this is not the "Olympia Storage" that was recommended in the <a href="https://dso.college.harvard.edu/coronavirusfaq" target="_blank">Harvard Coronavirus FAQ</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please feel free to explore your options. We just decided to pick ExtraSpace Storage and U-Hauls.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyways, we figured that since we're managing the U-Haul and storage logistics, we might as well help out our friends too. It's also more cost effective to rent bigger storage garages.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are interested in storing some boxes with us, we will help you out with last-minute storage by U-Hauling your stuff back-and-forth and by dealing with the storage logistics for you.

                <b>$10/cubic foot of storage, from March 14 - September 14</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This is $60 to store a 6 cubic ft. box from now until September. That’s <em>literally half a year</em> … and you just need to pack your box and drop it off at Adams House. Then in the Fall, just come to Adams House to pick it up.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Storage sucks because you’re literally paying to just have your stuff sit there for 6 months. <em>We also agree that it sucks</em>. We’re sorry that storage is so expensive but this is about as affordable as we could find elsewhere.

                <li>
                    Bob and his blockmates will move your boxes to the storage garage via U-Haul. Coordinate with Bob in September (prior to Sept. 14) and he will give you your boxes back from the storage garage. Easy-peasy.

                <b><em>Where the heck do I get storage boxes?</em></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Harvard is providing some <em>free boxes</em> to students, and you can find out where you can pick up boxes on the <a href="https://dso.college.harvard.edu/coronavirusfaq" target="_blank">Harvard Coronavirus FAQ</a>. Search (ctrl-f) for “pick up boxes”.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b><em>What payment options are there?</em></b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Venmo: no fee
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cash: no fee; exact change required
                </li>
                <li>
                    Credit Card or Debit Card: ~3% fee from PayPal >:(
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <b><em>How can I confirm that there is enough space to store my boxes?</em></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                After you submit the Google Form, Bob will send you an email within 12 hours to confirm that he has space for your boxes.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b><em>What if I find other storage after I submit the Google Form?</em></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                That's fine. You don't have to pay Bob until you drop off your boxes. You're chillin.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also try the HSA store, Staples, or Target.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b><em>What if I'm leaving campus before Saturday? Can I drop off my boxes before Saturday?</em></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Please submit the Google Form and directly contact Bob at <a href="mailto:storagewithbob@gmail.com">storagewithbob@gmail.com</a> about your situation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b><em>What if I want to access my stuff before to September?</em></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                That complicates things. We cannot guarantee that we will be around Cambridge area from April to August. If you want, please directly contact Bob at <a href="mailto:storagewithbob@gmail.com">storagewithbob@gmail.com</a> to see if we can figure something out.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b><em>What if I need to store my stuff after September?</em></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                That shouldn't be a big issue. If we have already rented the storage garage up to September, then we can easily renew our rental for additional months. If you plan to do this, please directly contact Bob at <a href="mailto:storagewithbob@gmail.com">storagewithbob@gmail.com</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b><em>My boxes are the HEAVY and my arms are the WEAK. Help!</em></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                You can borrow a hand dolly from YardOps or your Building Manager's office, if you leave your Student ID or Credit Card as collateral. It makes moving boxes a lot easier.

                            I asked the manager at ExtraSpace Storage what is allowed and he said “absolutely no open foods or drugs… like prescription drugs are fine but not illegal drugs”. We will not search your stuff. However, if rats or pests find your food or illegal drugs in the storage facility, the storage manager will throw your boxes out and <em>we are not liable for your stuff</em>.

                    We will only store <b>boxes or box-shaped items</b> (for example, mini-fridges and microwaves).

                        <li>
                            If your stuff is not in a box, but it is box-shaped (for example, a mini-fridge), then please email Bob at <a href="mailto:storagewithbob@gmail.com">storagewithbob@gmail.com</a> and he will check beforehand if your item will fit in alongside our other boxes in the storage garage.

                        <li>
                            In most cases, it’s not a problem and you will be fine. However, don’t try to screw us over with some wack shit. If you are in doubt, please put it into a box or email Bob.

                    You should know that <b>the storage facility is air-conditioned</b> at about 70 degrees Fahrenheit, or 21 degrees Celsius. Keep this in mind when you decide what to store and what to take home.
